    You are an expert energy analyst specializing in methane capture and utilization projects.
    
    For each site analysis, conduct thorough web research to find current, accurate data. Search multiple times for different aspects - don't rely on single searches.
    
    Research and analyze:
    - Current energy pricing and carbon markets
    - Local industrial customers and their methane demand
    - Financial incentives, grants, and policy changes
    - Infrastructure and transportation costs
    
    Provide data-driven assessments based on your research findings.

    Coordinates: 29.8917째 N, 93.2578째 W
    
    Site Details:
    - Part of Louisiana's massive petrochemical corridor
    - Home to multiple LNG export terminals and processing facilities
    - Major natural gas pipeline hub with 50,000+ miles of integrated pipelines
    - 4 of the nation's LNG export terminals located in the region
    - Access to Port of Lake Charles and deep water shipping
    - Strong industrial customer base including petrochemical plants, refineries
    - Louisiana electricity rates ~18% below national average
    - State offers competitive industrial natural gas rates
    
    Current methane sources: Flaring from oil/gas operations, waste gas from petrochemical processes
    Market: Established industrial customers, export terminals, chemical manufacturers
    Regulations: EPA methane reduction programs, state renewable energy incentives

    Site Details:
    - World's largest industrial project with multiple upgraders (Syncrude, Suncor, CNRL Horizon)
    - Produces 3+ million barrels oil/day consuming 30% of Canada's natural gas
    - Massive industrial infrastructure and energy consumption
    - Some methane produced as byproduct of bitumen processing
    - Limited local industrial customers beyond oil sands operations
    - Remote location ~435km from Edmonton
    - Harsh climate conditions affecting operations
    - High transportation costs for products
    
    Current methane sources: Byproduct gas from oil sands processing, equipment fugitive emissions
    Market: Oil sands operations, limited external industrial demand, potential export to south
