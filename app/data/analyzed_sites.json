    ],
    "analysis_defense": "The viability score of 8/10 is justified by several key factors:\n\n1. **Product Selection - Methanol**: Based on the Canadian Gas Association's Carbon Utilization Market Report, methanol has a growing market in Canada with a 3.7% CAGR and 775,000 tonnes of annual demand. The Methanex 2024 Annual Report confirms current market prices of $355 USD/tonne, providing strong economics for CO2-to-methanol conversion.\n\n2. **Market Access**: The site is approximately 450 km from Alberta's Industrial Heartland (Edmonton/Fort Saskatchewan area), which the Canadian Gas Association report confirms is a major petrochemical hub. While beyond 100 km, the oil sands region itself has significant industrial demand for methanol in upgrading operations, as noted in the Enerkem report discussing CO2 utilization from steam methane reforming operations at refineries.\n\n3. **Financial Incentives**: Alberta offers multiple stacked incentives totaling potential support of over 60% of capital costs through ACCIP (12% grant), federal CCUS ITC (up to 50%), and additional TIER carbon credits worth CAD $80/tonne in 2024. The IEE CCUS Grant Program provides additional funding opportunities.\n\n4. **CO2 Supply**: The oil sands operations provide abundant, concentrated CO2 streams from upgraders and steam generation, making capture more economical than from dilute sources.\n\n5. **Infrastructure**: The region has existing industrial infrastructure, utilities, and workforce familiar with chemical processing, reducing implementation barriers.",
    "site_summary": "Fort McMurray Oil Sands Industrial Park presents a highly viable opportunity for CO2-to-methanol conversion with a score of 8/10. The site benefits from abundant concentrated CO2 from oil sands operations, strong methanol market fundamentals ($355 USD/tonne), and exceptional government support through stacked incentives potentially covering over 60% of capital costs. While the nearest major petrochemical hub is 450 km away in Edmonton's Industrial Heartland, local demand from oil sands upgrading operations can absorb initial production. The combination of Alberta's ACCIP program (12% capital grant), federal CCUS tax credits (up to 50%), and TIER carbon credits ($80 CAD/tonne) creates compelling project economics. With Canada's methanol market growing at 3.7% annually and reaching 775,000 tonnes, this location offers a strategic entry point for CO2 utilization in one of Canada's most carbon-intensive industrial regions.",
