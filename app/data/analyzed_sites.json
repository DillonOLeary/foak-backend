    "summary": "Fort McMurray presents a highly profitable CO2 utilization opportunity with methanol production offering $315/tonne profit margins. The site benefits from proximity to oil sands operations providing abundant CO2 feedstock, existing Alberta Carbon Trunk Line infrastructure, and strong industrial demand in the region. With multiple funding mechanisms totaling over $5.3M in available incentives and established chemical facilities within 50km, the location offers excellent economics for large-scale CO2-to-methanol conversion despite higher capture costs in the oil sands sector.",
