With over 250 production facilities and 8,000 chemical products produced annually, the site has substantial internal demand for methanol as a key building block. BASF has already demonstrated commitment to CO2 utilization through its OASE blue carbon capture technology, which has been deployed in over 500 reference plants globally. The company is actively developing a CO2-neutral methanol production process and has partnered with Forestal for e-methanol production using captured CO2.

The economics are compelling despite relatively high electricity costs of $0.255/kWh, as Germany's industrial electricity prices have moderated from 2022-2023 peaks. At current methanol prices of $530/MT, the margin potential remains attractive, especially considering available government incentives. The Federal Funding for Industry and Climate Protection (BIK) program offers up to EUR 3 billion in funding through 2030 specifically for CCUS applications, while the Climate and Transformation Fund provides EUR 100 billion over 12 years for decarbonization projects.

Technical feasibility is enhanced by BASF's existing infrastructure, including a new 54 MW water electrolyzer commissioned in 2025 that produces renewable hydrogen - a critical input for CO2-to-methanol conversion. The site's Verbund concept enables efficient integration of new processes through its 2,850 km of pipelines connecting production facilities. The Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region provides robust local demand, being home to major automotive, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries that consume methanol and its derivatives.

Key risks include competition from conventional methanol imports and the need for continuous renewable electricity supply. However, BASF's strategic focus on sustainable products and its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 positions this project favorably. The company's expertise in gas treatment, established hydrogen infrastructure, and strong customer relationships in the region create significant competitive advantages for successful implementation.
